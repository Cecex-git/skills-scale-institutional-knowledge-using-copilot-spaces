# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme project management documentation. This guide serves as a central entry point for understanding how OctoAcme runs projects, defining roles, and accessing our process documentation.

## Overview

OctoAcme follows a structured yet iterative approach to project management that emphasizes customer value, clear ownership, and continuous improvement. Our processes are designed to ensure successful project delivery while maintaining transparency and alignment across all stakeholders.

### Key Workflows

Our project management lifecycle consists of five core phases:

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem statement, identify stakeholders, establish success metrics, and create a high-level timeline. This phase ensures we validate business needs before committing resources.

2. **Planning**: Break down work into actionable increments, create a prioritized backlog, estimate scope, identify dependencies and risks, and establish release timelines. Planning includes kickoff meetings and alignment on Definition of Done.

3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, and review work in iterative cycles. Teams follow agreed sprint cadences, track progress using project boards, and continuously validate against acceptance criteria.

4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy verified features, coordinate with stakeholders, announce releases, and ensure proper monitoring and rollback plans are in place.

5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings, celebrate successes, identify improvement opportunities, and create actionable next steps for future projects.

### Team Roles

OctoAcme projects involve several key roles, each with distinct responsibilities:

- **Project Managers (PM)**: Coordinate delivery activities, manage schedules and timelines, track risks and dependencies, facilitate meetings, and maintain project documentation and status reporting.

- **Product Managers (PdM)**: Define product vision and outcomes, prioritize the backlog, collaborate with stakeholders on trade-offs, validate solutions through research and metrics, and measure success.

- **Developers**: Implement features and fixes, write and maintain tests and documentation, participate in design and code reviews, assist in estimation and planning, and identify technical risks.

- **QA/Testing Specialists**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria, create and execute test plans, ensure proper test coverage, and maintain high quality standards throughout the delivery process.

- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals, participate in milestone reviews, and support cross-functional coordination.

### Communication Strategies

Effective communication is central to OctoAcme's project success:

- **Weekly syncs** between Project Managers and Product Managers to align on priorities and address issues
- **Twice-weekly standups** for delivery teams (or as agreed) to coordinate daily work and remove blockers
- **Monthly stakeholder updates** to keep leadership and cross-functional partners informed
- **Ad-hoc escalations** as needed to address urgent issues or decisions
- **Weekly status reports** covering progress, next steps, risks, blockers, and decisions needed
- **Risk registers** maintained and reviewed regularly to track mitigation actions

### Quality Assurance Practices

OctoAcme maintains high quality standards through:

- **Clear acceptance criteria** defined for all backlog items before work begins
- **Definition of Done (DoD)** established and agreed upon by the team
- **Test coverage requirements** including unit, integration, and acceptance testing
- **Code reviews** conducted by peers before merging changes
- **Iterative validation** with continuous testing and feedback loops
- **Post-release monitoring** to verify successful deployment and catch issues early
- **Blameless retrospectives** to learn from incidents and improve processes

## Getting Started

New team members and stakeholders should:

1. Start by reading the [Project Management Overview](octoacme-project-management-overview.md) to understand core principles
2. Review the [Roles and Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) document to understand your role and responsibilities
3. Familiarize yourself with the specific process documents relevant to your current project phase
4. Reference the [Risk Management & Communication](octoacme-risks-and-communication.md) guide for communication templates and escalation paths

For project-specific documentation, check the `.copilot/` directory in your project repository where teams often store context for Copilot Spaces.

## Principles

All OctoAcme projects adhere to these core principles:

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments rather than big-bang releases
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has named Project Manager and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless problem-solving
